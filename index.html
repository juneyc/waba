<h2>June Chepkwony</h2>
<p>I love to swim, bangee jump, a little of paint balling wouldn't hurt the soul. The list would definetly not be complete without mentioning ziplining and sky diving.</p>
<p>At my spare time, I love to read books, Danielle Steele happens to be my favorite author. Watching movies has made me a couch potato and I guess because I am an introvert.  </p>
<p>My friends think that I am an extrovert just because I am social, but I differ with them on some level.Let's now jump into my kind of past time activities</p>
<p>The list is endless, however, let's delve into a few</p>
<h3>Past time activities:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Brisk walk</li>
    <li>Swimming</li>
<li>Friends hang out</li>
